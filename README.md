# Bitcoin Private Key Finder

## Project Overview
The **Bitcoin Private Key Finder** is a Python-based tool designed to generate Bitcoin private keys and attempt to find corresponding Bitcoin addresses from a predefined database. The application operates using multi-threading to quickly generate addresses, benchmark key generation speed, and perform database lookups for address matching. This tool is intended for educational and demonstration purposes only, as finding a specific Bitcoin key randomly is computationally infeasible.

## Installation
To run this project, make sure you have Python 3.x installed, along with the necessary dependencies. You can install the required packages by using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies
- `ecdsa`
- `hashlib`
- `base58`
- `sqlite3`
- `threading`
- `colorama`
- `tqdm`
- `secrets`

> Note: If you have not created `requirements.txt` yet, you may need to create it with the contents based on installed libraries.

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository** or download the files into your local environment.
2. Ensure that you have the `bitcoin_addresses.db` file with the Bitcoin addresses you want to check or create it using the setup function.
3. Run the main program:
   ```bash
   python bitcoin_key_finder.py
   ```
4. Choose an option from the command-line menu:
   - **Benchmark**: Test private key generation speed.
   - **Scan**: Check Bitcoin addresses in the database.
   - **Exit**: Close the program.

## Features
- **Multi-threaded Key Generation**: Speed up the address generation process with multiple threads.
- **Benchmarking**: Measure the key generation and address derivation speed.
- **Database Lookup**: Check generated addresses against a pre-defined database of Bitcoin addresses.
- **Logging**: Found keys are logged to a file for review.

### Explanation of Main Files
- **bitcoin_key_finder.py**: Contains the primary logic for generating private keys, deriving Bitcoin addresses, scanning addresses, and managing the user interface.
- **Python Btc_P_K_cu.py**: Contains an optimized version of the key finder with multithreading and advanced progress tracking using `tqdm`.
- **recover_BTCPK.py**: An additional script for key recovery and other enhancements.
- **found_keys.txt**: Output log where successfully found private keys and their corresponding Bitcoin addresses are stored.

## Important Notices
- This tool is designed for demonstration and educational purposes, and it is crucial to understand that finding a specific Bitcoin private key randomly from a pool is practically impossible due to the vastness of the keyspace.
- Ensure that you have permissions to access and modify the database used in this tool.
- Use this program ethically and legally.
